				<p>
				Bottoms up! <br>
				Let's start building the torso.<br>
				<br>
				Using the needles and yarn that you chose to achieve your gauge, cast on %i stitches.
				</p>
				<p class= "comment">---REMINDER:  this pattern is in the round!</p>

				<p>Loop around from your last cast on, back to your first.
				Make sure to use a marker to keep track of where your row starts.
				Start working in the pattern stitch you used to achieve your gauge.
				</p>
				<p class="comment">---SAVOR THIS MOMENT!!! IT'S GONNA BE ***GORGEOUS!!!***</p>
				<p>
				Continue working in your chosen stitch until work measures %.1f inches. 
				(Should be about %i rows, but do whatever feels right!)
				</p>
				<p>
				Continue in your pattern stitch for %i stitches.
				We're halfway!! Cast off %i stitches.
				Continue the row in your pattern stitch for %i stitches.
				Again, cast off %i stitches. Don't lose your marker! ;)
