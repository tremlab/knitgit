******************* 
*** TORSO START ***
*******************

Bottoms up! Let's start building the torso.


Using the needles and yarn that you chose to achieve your gauge, cast on %i stitches.

---REMINDER:  this pattern is in the round!

Loop around from your last cast on, back to your first.
Make sure to use a marker to keep track of where your row starts.
Start working in the pattern stitch you used to achieve your gauge.

---SAVOR THIS MOMENT!!! IT'S GONNA BE ***GORGEOUS!!!***

Continue working in your chosen stitch until work measures %.1f inches. 
(Should be about %i rows, but do whatever feels right!)

Continue in your pattern stitch for %i stitches.
We're halfway!! Cast off %i stitches.
Continue the row in your pattern stitch for %i stitches.
Again, cast off %i stitches. Don't lose your marker! ;)

---It may not look like much, but you just finished the biggest piece of this sweater!  
---You **so** got this!!
