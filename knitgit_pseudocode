PYTHON

Build functions to refine user inputs for easy calculations

  stiches_inch
      st_gauge = float(int(raw_gauge_stitches) / 4)  #gauge will always be str -> int, converting to float for accuracy
      
  rows_inch
      r_gauge = float(int(raw_gauge_rows) / 4)   #gauge will always be str -> int, converting to float for accuracy
      
  torso_length
      trs_length = float(raw_torso_length)  #string to float for calculations
      
  torso_width
      trs_width = float(raw_torso_width) #string to float for calculations
      
  sleeve_length
      sl_length = float(raw_sleeve_length)  #string to float for calculations
      
  sleeve_width
      trs_width = float(raw_torso_width) * 0.??? #calulate ratio from torso#   #string to float for calculations


Build functions to calculate each pattern part
  
  torso:
    trs_cast_on
    trs_shape_armhole
  sleeve:
    sl_cast_on
    length
    taper??
    sl_shape_armhole
  
  neckline:
    join sleeves to torso
    nk_decrease 
        until neckline width
    nk_castoff






Instructions:
    generic text instructions/intro
  
   
Output

  pull all input and calculations into one user-frinedly, complete text output

HTML/Javascript/CSS (hopefully!!)
  Basic HTML so user can interface with familiar website rather than command line
    jpegs
    form
    printable output?
    
  Would love to revisit some of my JavaScript knowledge to make a dynamic page - will depend on time & success with the core python
