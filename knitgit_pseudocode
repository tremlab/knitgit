Build functions to calculate each pattern part
  
  body:

    length
    shape armhole
    shape neckline
    cast off
  
  sleeve:
    cast on
    length
    taper
    shape armhole

    generic text instructions - same for all sweater outputs

Build functions to ask for user parameters

  instructions:
    generic text instructions/intro
  
  ask for input:
    gauge (desired stitches per inch)
      horizontal
      vertical
    body width
    body length
    sleeve length
    
Output

  pull all input and calculations into one user-frinedly, complete text output

HTML/Javascript/CSS (hopefully!!)
  Basic HTML so user can interface with familiar website rather than command line
    jpegs
    form
    printable output?
    
  Would love to revisit some of my JavaScript knowledge to make a dynamic page - will depend on time & success with the core python
